# alx-pre_course

This repository contains the files and documentation for the ALX pre-course.

## Collaboration: Be Up to Date

To stay up to date with your co-workers' changes, follow these steps:

1. Open GitHub.com and navigate to the repository where you want to update your file README.md in the main branch.

2. Edit the README.md file directly on GitHub.com. Make the necessary changes and save the file.

3. Open your terminal.

4. Change to the directory of your local repository using the `cd` command.

5. To get all the changes of the main branch locally, use the following command:
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```

6. Create a new file called "up_to_date" at the root of your directory. You can use a text editor or run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   touch up_to_date
   ```

7. Open the "up_to_date" file and write down the git command line used in the previous step. For example, you can write:
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```

8. Add the "up_to_date" file to git using the following command:
   ```
   git add up_to_date
   ```

9. Commit the changes with a descriptive message using the following command:
   ```
   git commit -m "How to be up to date in git"
   ```

10. Finally, push the changes to the origin (remote repository) using the following command:
    ```
    git push origin main
    ```

By following these steps, you will have updated your file README.md from GitHub.com, pulled the changes to your local repository, created a new file documenting the git command used, and pushed the changes to the remote repository.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

When merging branches, conflicts can occur. To resolve merge conflicts, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Change to the directory of your local repository using the `cd` command.

3. Before resolving the conflicts, create a new branch to work on:
   ```
   git checkout -b resolve-conflicts
   ```

4. Merge the branch `update_script` into `main`:
   ```
   git merge update_script
   ```

5. Resolve conflicts in the conflicting file(s) by editing them manually. Remove conflict markers and keep the desired changes.

6. Mark the conflicts as resolved:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

7. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
   ```

8. Push the changes to the origin:
   ```
   git push origin resolve-conflicts
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve merge conflicts and push the result to the origin without any conflicts.

## Never Push Too Much

To prevent pushing unnecessary files, create a .gitignore file and define rules. In this case, we want to ignore ~ files generated by Emacs.

1. Open your terminal.

2. Change to the directory of your local repository using the `cd` command.

3. Create a new file called ".gitignore" in the root directory of your repository:
   ```
   touch .gitignore
   ```

4. Open the ".gitignore" file in a text editor.

5. Add the following line to ignore ~ files:
   ```
   *~
   ```

6. Save the ".gitignore" file.

7. Stage and commit the ".gitignore" file:
   ```
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add .gitignore file to ignore ~ files"
   ```

8. Push the changes to the origin:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

By following these steps, you have created a .gitignore file and defined a rule to never push ~ files generated by Emacs.
